Developers can set breakpoints to pause code execution at specific lines or conditions to inspect variables, evaluate expressions, and step through code.</li>
        <li>Call stack window; Shows the current execution path of the program, listing function calls in the order they were invoked. Developers can navigate through the call stack to understand how execution reached a particular point and examine variables at different levels of the call hierarchy.</li>
        <li>Immediate window; Allows developers to execute code and evaluate expressions interactively during debugging. Useful for testing snippets of code, modifying variables on-the-fly, or investigating complex expressions without altering the codebase.</li>
        <li>Exception settings; Configures how Visual Studio handles exceptions, allowing developers to break execution when exceptions are thrown, even if they are handled. Provides detailed information about exceptions, including call stacks and inner exceptions.</li>
        <li>Data Tips and Inline Value Inspection; Hovering over variables during debugging displays their current values (data tips) inline in the editor. Allows quick inspection without navigating to separate windows, enhancing productivity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Using Debugging Tools to Identify and Fix Issues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Setting breakpoints; Place breakpoints at critical points in the code where issues may occur.</li>
        <li>Inspecting variables; Use watch windows (Locals, Autos, Watch) to monitor variable values as the code executes.</li>
        <li>Analyzing call stack; Review the call stack to trace the sequence of function calls leading to the current execution point.</li>
        <li>Using diagnostic tools; Use performance profiler to identify performance bottlenecks, memory profiler to detect memory leaks, and concurrency visualizer to diagnose threading issues.</li>
        <li>Handling exceptions; Configure exception settings to break on thrown exceptions, even if they are handled by try-catch blocks.</li>
    </ul>
